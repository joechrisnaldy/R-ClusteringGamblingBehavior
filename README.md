# R-ClusteringGamblingBehavior
Use cluster analysis to glean insights into cryptocurrency gambling behavior.

## **Introduction** </br>
The similarities and differences in the behaviours of different people have long been of interest, particularly in psychology and other social science fields. Understanding human behaviour in particular contexts can help us to make informed decisions. Consider a poker game - understanding why players raise, call, and fold in various situations can provide a competitive advantage. Our goal will be to define groups or clusters of Bustabit users to identify what patterns and behaviours of gambling persist.

## **Conclusion** </br>
Though most of the statistical and programmatical work has been completed, the essential part of cluster analysis is to interpret the resulting clusters. This often is the most desired aspect of the research by clients, who are hoping to use the results of your analysis to inform better business decision-making and actionable items. As a final step, we'll use the parallel coordinate plot and cluster means table to interpret the Bustabit gambling user groups! Roughly speaking, we can breakdown the groups as follows:</br> </br>
Risky Commoners:</br>
These users seem to be a step above the Cautious Commoners in their Bustabit gambling habits, making larger average bets, and playing a larger number of games on the site. As a result, though they have about the same number of average games won as the Risk Takers, they have a significantly higher number of games lost.</br></br>
High Rollers:</br>
High bets are the name of the game for this group. They bet large sums of money in each game, although they tend to cash out at lower multipliers and thus play the game more conservatively, particularly compared to the Risk-Takers. Interestingly, these users have also, on average, earned net positive earnings from their games played.</br></br>
Risk Takers: </br>
These users have played only a couple of games on average. Still, their average cashed-out value is significantly higher than the other clusters, indicating that they tend to wait for the multiplier to increase to large values before cashing out.</br></br>
Cautious Commoners:</br>
This is the largest of the five clusters and might be described as the more casual Bustabit players. They've played the fewest number of games overall and tend to make more conservative bets in general. </br></br>
Strategic Addicts:</br>
These users play a lot of games on Bustabit, but tend to keep their bets under control. As a result, they've made on average a net positive earnings from the site, despite having the most games played. They seem to maintain a strategy (or an automated script/bot) that works to earn them money.
